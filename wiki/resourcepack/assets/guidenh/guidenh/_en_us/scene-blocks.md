# Block Scenes

Block rendering, TileEntity, and non-full-block tests inside `<GameScene>`.

## Water & Transparent Blocks

<GameScene zoom={4} interactive={true}>
    <Block id="minecraft:water" />
    <Block id="minecraft:water" x="-1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:water" x="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:grass" z="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:grass" x="1" z="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:glass" z="2" />
    <Block id="minecraft:glass" x="1" z="2" />
</GameScene>

## Redstone Circuit

This scene does not declare `<BlockStats>`, but the block-stat toggle button is still available
because the scene contains blocks. Opening it shows the default inside list, capped to 25% of the
scene size.

<GameScene zoom={4} interactive={true}>
    <Block id="minecraft:stone" />
    <Block id="minecraft:stone" x="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:stone" x="2" />
    <Block id="minecraft:redstone_wire" y="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:redstone_wire" x="1" y="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:redstone_wire" x="2" y="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:lever" x="-1" y="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:redstone_lamp" x="3" y="1" />
</GameScene>

## Block Statistics Overlay

Automatic mode counts the blocks already present in the scene and places the semi-transparent
list inside the selected corner.
It also expands supported compound blocks such as AE2 cable bus parts and facades,
ForgeMultipart parts, and Carpenters' Blocks covers or overlays.

<GameScene zoom={4} interactive={true}>
    <Block id="minecraft:stone" />
    <Block id="minecraft:stone" x="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:stone" x="2" />
    <Block id="minecraft:furnace" x="1" y="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:torch" x="2" y="1" />
    <BlockStats dock="right" showNames={true} maxWidth="180" maxHeight="96" />
</GameScene>

Click a block-stat item to highlight all matching scene placements with an always-on-top face
overlay using each resolved collision box. The item count is rendered by the ItemStack overlay, and
its tooltip includes the exact block count.

Manual mode can show a planned material list instead of the literal scene contents.

<GameScene zoom={4} interactive={true}>
    <Block id="minecraft:furnace" />
    <Block id="minecraft:cobblestone" x="1" />
    <Block id="minecraft:cobblestone" x="-1" />
    <BlockStats mode="manual" corner="bottomRight" maxWidth="160" maxHeight="96">
        <BlockStat item="minecraft:cobblestone" count="8" />
        <BlockStat item="minecraft:furnace" count="1" />
    </BlockStats>
</GameScene>

## BlockAnnotationTemplate

Applies a `<DiamondAnnotation>` to every instance of the given block id in the scene.

<GameScene zoom="2" interactive={true}>
  <Block id="minecraft:log" />
  <Block id="minecraft:log" x="1" />
  <Block id="minecraft:log" z="1" />
  <Block id="minecraft:log" x="1" z="1" />

  <BlockAnnotationTemplate id="minecraft:log">
    <DiamondAnnotation pos="0.5 0.5 0.5" color="#ff0000">
      This will be shown in the tooltip! <ItemImage id="minecraft:stone" />
    </DiamondAnnotation>
  </BlockAnnotationTemplate>
</GameScene>

## End Portal Frame

<GameScene zoom="8" interactive={true}>
  <Block id="minecraft:end_portal_frame" />
  <Block id="minecraft:end_portal_frame" x="1" />
  <Block id="minecraft:end_portal_frame" x="2" />
  <Block id="minecraft:end_portal_frame" z="2" />
  <Block id="minecraft:end_portal_frame" x="1" z="2" />
  <Block id="minecraft:end_portal_frame" x="2" z="2" />
  <Block id="minecraft:end_portal_frame" z="1" />
  <Block id="minecraft:end_portal_frame" x="2" z="1" />
</GameScene>
